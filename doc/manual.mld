{1:request Request elements}

The idea behind [Hc] is to allow any HTML element to perform requests
on the server for HTML fragments. These requests are specified via the
{{!data_request}[data-request]} attribute. We call {e request
elements}, elements that bear such an attribute.

In the following example:

{v
<button data-request="POST /clicked"
        data-effect="element">Replace me</button>
v}

The button is a request element. The request is performed when the
event specified via the {{!data_event}[data-event]} attribute occurs.
For buttons, if unspecified, this is the [click] event.

What happens exactly on a request is fully specified by the connection
cycle which we describe next.

{1:connection Connection cycle}

Each request element defines a connection cycle in which a few other
elements take part. All these other elements are always defined via
attributes of the request element. They can all point to the same
element. In particular if they are not specified they mostly default
to the request element.

{ul
{- The {e request} element. This is the element that has the
   {{!data_request}[data-request]} attribute. It is the
   element that specifies the connection to the server.}
{- The {e event source} elements, specified by
   the {{!data_event_src}[data-event-src]} attribute. They
   are the elements whose events specified in the {{!data_event_src}
   [data-event]} attribute triggers the request.}
{- The {e query} elements, specified by the {{!data_query}[data-query]}
   attribute. These are the element that are looked up to devise the
   request's query data (in the request URL for [GET] and [HEAD], in
   the body otherwise).}
{- The {e target} element. This is the element specified by the
   {{!data_target}[data-target]} attribute. It specifies the
   relative location of the request response effect, that is where
   and how the HTML fragment from the server gets inserted in the page.}
{- The {e feedback} element(s), specified by {{!data_feedback}[data-feedback]}.
   These are additional elements on which the connection cycle is feedback
   using classes.}}

Every request element on the page cycle through the following steps.

{ol
{- Wait for the element's {{!data_event}request event} to happen.}
{- Determine from the element's attributes, the {{!data_request}kind of
   request}, its {{!data_query}query} data, the
   {{!data_target}target} element, the {{!data_effect}effect} and the
   {{!data_feedback}feedback} {e element(s)}.}
{- Perform the request with the {{:data_query}query}. Redirections
   are followed. The request and feedback elements get classified
   as [hc-request]}
{- Wait for the response. If an error occurs classify
   the request and feedback elements with [hc-error] and stop here.
   Otherwise unclassify [hc-request] and proceed. }
{- Process any {{!response_headers}special header} in the response. This
   may stop the cycle here (e.g. on {{!header_reload}reload} or
   {{!header_redirect}redirect}).}
{- Using the HTML fragment found in the server response, perform the
   {{:data_effect}effect} on the {{:data_target}target}. If elements
   are being removed from the page, they first get classified with
   {{!class_hc_out}[hc-out]} for a while before being effectively removed.
   Elements that are introduced get transiently classified with
   {{!class_hc_in}[hc-in].}}
{- If the request is:
   {ul
   {- a websocket, loop to 1 with the same socket.}
   {- SSE connection, loop to 4.}
   {- Otherwise loop to 1 (if the element still exists
      after the effect)}}}}

{1:css_class_feedback CSS class feedback}

The following classes can be used to track the connection cycle.

{2:class_hc_request [hc-request]}

This class is applied on the {{!data_request}request element} and the
{{!data_feedback}feedback element(s)} whenever a request to the server
is ongoing.

This class can be used to trigger a CSS animation if the request is
taking too much time. For example assuming you have a [.spinner] in
your request element, the following shows the spinner if the request
is taking longer than 500ms.

{v
.spinner { visibility: hidden; }
.hc-request .spinner { animation: spin 1s linear 500ms infinite; }

@keyframes spin
{ from { visibility: visible; } to { transform: rotate(360deg); }}
v}

{2:class_hc_error [hc-error]}

This class is applied on the {{!data_request}request element} and
the {{!data_feedback}feedback element} whenever a request failed.
This includes if the request returns a 4XX or 5XX result.

{2:class_hc_in [hc-in] and [hc-in-parent]}

These classes are applied for a small amount of time (one render
frame) when the {{!data_effect}effect} is performed. [hc-in] is
applied on the root of HTML trees that are inserted in the DOM by the
effect. [hc-in-parent] is applied on their parent.

These classes are used to trigger CSS animations. For example to fade
in an element in 250ms on insertion use:

{v
.my-element.hc-in { opacity: 0; }
.my-element { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; }
v}

{2:class_hc_out [hc-out] and [hc-out-parent]}

These classes are applied on elements (if any) that are removed by the
{{!data_effect}effect} just before it is performed.  [hc-out] is
applied on elements that will be removed. [hc-out-parent] is on their
parent.

To determine the amount of time during which the classes are applied
before the effect is performed, first the classes are applied on the
elements. Then for each of these elements we take the maximum value of
either CSS attribute [--hc-out-duration], [animation-duration] or
[transition-duration]. The maximal value of all these durations defines
the duration.

If the elements animating are descendent of those that are classified
by [hc-out] or [hc-out-parent], use the [--hc-out-duration] attribute
on the [.hc-out] elements to set the time needed. For example the
following ensures that the [hc-out] and [hc-out-parent] classes are
maintained on the elements to be removed for 500ms before being
effectively removed:

{v
.hc-out { --hc-out-duration: 500ms }
v}

{1:attref Attribute reference}

The only attribute required for an HTML element to be connected to
your server is {{!data_request}data-request} which specifies the
request to initiate the connection.

{2:data_request [data-request="[<m>] <url>"]}

This attribute drives it all. If unspecified the element has no
connection to the server and all other [data-*] attributes are
ignored.

[<url>] is the URL to request, use the [ws://] or [wss://] scheme for
a websocket connection. [<m>] is the HTTP request method or [SSE]
to request a server sent events connection; defaults to [GET]
if unspecified.

{2:data_query [data-query="<sel>"]}

The value of [<sel>] determines the elements that are used to
specify the query of the request.
If unspecified this is the {{!data_request}request element} itself.

The final query of the request is determined by taking the query part of
the {{!data_request}requested URL} and for each of the elements
selected by [<sel>] appending:

{ul
{- If the element is a [form], the form data as gathered by
   {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData}
   [FormData].}}
{- If the element has a {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefvalue}value} property [<value>]
   and the element has a [name] property value [<name>], a
   [<name>] to [<value>] binding. If the element has no [name]
   use ["value"] for the [<name>].}
{- Otherwise, nothing.}}

The query is transmitted in the URL on [GET] or [HEAD] requests and
otherwise in the request body encoded with
[application/x-www-form-urlencoded] unless there is a file input in
which case [multipart/form-data] is used.

{2:data_event [data-event="<ev> <mod>*"]}

[<ev>] is the name of the JavaScript event of the
{{!data_event_src}event source} that triggers requests. [<mod>] are
modifiers for the event:

{ul
{- [once], the event is triggered only once.}
{- [debounce:<dur>], a debouncing time, the request only
   occurs after duration [<time>] of the {e last} event occurence.}
{- [throttle:<dur>], a throttling time, the request occurs
   immediatly but won't occur again before duration [<dur>].}
{- [filter:<jsfun>], name of a filtering function. The function
   is given the requesting element and the event, if it returns
   [false] the event did not occur.}}

If the attribute is unspecified this is:
{ul
{- [submit] for [form] elements.}
{- [change] for [input], [textarea] and [select].}
{- [click] otherwise.}}

{2:data_event_src [data-event-src="<sel>"]}

The DOM element(s), as {{!selector}selected} by [<sel>], whose
{{!data_event}events} are being listened for to trigger a request.
If unspecified this is the {{!data_request}request element} itself.

{2:data_target [data-target="<sel>"]}

The target DOM element, as selected by the first element of [<sel>],
on which the {{!data_request}request} response performs its
{{!data_effect}effect}. If unspecified this is the
{{!data_request}request element} itself.

{2:data_effect [data-effect="<eff>"]}

The value [<eff>] determines the way the HTML response is used on
the {{!data_target}target}. This can be:

{ul
{- [children] to replaces the children of the target (default).}
{- [element] to replaces the target itself.}
{- [beforebegin] to insert before the target.}
{- [afterbegin] to insert before the first child of the target.}
{- [beforeend] to insert after the last child of the target.}
{- [afterend] to insert after the target.}
{- [none] to discard the HTML response.}
{- [event <ev>] to discard the HTML response but trigger an event named
   [<ev>] on the target}}

If unspecified this is [children].

{2:data_feedback [data-feedback="<sel>"]}

DOM elements in addition to {{!data_target}target element} on which
the connection cycle is feedback with
{{!class_hc_request}[hc-request]} and {{!class_hc_error}[hc-error]}.

{1:selector Selector syntax}

Attributes of [hc] use
{{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors}CSS
selectors} with
{{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector}
[querySelector]} to gather query data and target response effects. However
CSS selectors have no syntax for addressing ancestors. We slightly extend the
syntax to allow it because in many cases this eschews the need to use
element identifiers which improves modularity – use with care, it can
also improve {e obscurity}.

We allow a CSS selector to be prefixed by a sequence of ancestor
specifications which select the root on which the CSS selector is then
applied. This provides full tree addressing: first move up to find an
ancestor and then down by applying the CSS selector to it.

An ancestor specification is made of an optional element, optional
classes and the made up [:up] pseudo-class. The semantic is to move up
from the element by following the up selectors from left-to-right and
then apply the CSS selector on ancestor that was found.

Examples:
{v
  :up                # parent
  :up :up            # parent's parent
  :up :up :scope > * # parent's parent's children
  .beet.root:up      # ancestor with classes beet and root
  .beet:up .root:up  # move to beet ancestor, then to root ancestor
  ul.beet.root:up    # ul ancestor with classes beet and root
  div:up .beet       # div ancestor, beet classified descendents
v}

The full syntax as an {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234}RFC 5234 ABNF}
grammar is described as follows:

{v
         sel = *(up SP) css-selector
          up = [[el] *class] ":up"
          el = 1*(ALPHA)
       class = "." 1*(ALPHA)
css-selector = …   # See the CSS specification
v}

{1:response_headers Response HTTP headers}

The server should respond with an HTML fragment to be inserted with
respect to the {{!data_target}request target}. Additionally it can use
the headers described next to control the client.

{2:header_redirect [hc-redirect: <url>]}

Redirects the page to [<url>]. The body of the response is ignored by [Hc].

{2:header_reload [hc-reload: true]}

Reloads the page. The body of the response is igored by [Hc].

{2:header_location_push [hc-location-push: <url>]}

Pushes location [<url>] on the history stack.

{2:header_location_replace [hc-location-replace: <url>]}

Replaces current location by [<url>] (without reloading). Has no effect
if {{!header_location_push}[hc-location-push]} is present.

{2:header_location_title [hc-location-title: <pct-title>]}

Replaces the current title by percent encoded title [<pct-title>].
Mostly used in conjunction with {{!header_location_push}[hc-location-push]}
or {{!header_location_replace}[hc-location-replace]}.

{1:request_headers Request HTTP headers}

{2:header_hc [hc: true]}

Indicates the request is made by [Hc].

{2:header_referer [referer: <url>]}

This is the standard HTTP [referer] header, it indicates the URL of
the page (without the fragment) that performs the request. [hc] makes
requests with the
{{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy#directives}
[same-origin]} policy.

If your HTML fragment returns relative URLs they will be interpreted
relative to [<url>] once they are injected in the DOM.


{b FIXME.} We should likely make that or at least the policy,
tweakable in some way.

synopsis: "Active HTML elements for dynamic webpages"
description: """\
Htmlact declares dynamic webpages by using HTML data attributes to
seamlessly update the page with HTML fragments requested from the
server.

Using HTML as the interaction substrate keeps logic on the server and,
in the simplest cases, reduces front-end client code to custom CSS
animations and inclusion of a generic JavaScript driver.

Htmlact is distributed under the ISC license. Compilation of the 
JavaScript driver depends on [brr].

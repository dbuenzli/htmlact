synopsis: "Hypertext connection for dynamic web pages"
description: """\
Hc declares dynamic web pages by using HTML data attributes to
seamlessly update the page with HTML fragments requested from the
server.

Using hypertext as the interaction substrate keeps logic on the server
and, in the simplest cases, reduces front-end client code to custom
CSS animations and inclusion of a generic JavaScript driver.

Hc is distributed under the ISC license. Compilation of the JavaScript
driver depends on [brr][brr].
